# Secrets-Project

This is a project that allows users to store and manage their secrets securely. It uses the form-data and send modules to handle form submissions and file transfers.

## Setup

To set up the project, first install the necessary modules by running `npm install`. This will install the form-data and send modules, among others. To use the form-data module, require it in your file with `var FormData = require('form-data');`. You can then create a new form and append fields to it. To use the send module, require it in your file with `var send = require('send');`. You can then use it to send files as HTTP responses.

```
npm install
```
